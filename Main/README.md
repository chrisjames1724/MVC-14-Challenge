# MVC-14-Challenge

# Description
In this assignment we were supposed to create a CMS style blogspot where users can publish their blog posts as well as comment on others blog posts as well.  Since this assignment was due during our Group 2 project we were given starter code so that we did not have to spend the time building the entire project from scratch. There were a few bugs we needed to identify and fix to get the website up and running. The user needs to sign in or sign up if they have not established a login username or password already. Using sessions we were able to allow the user to stay logged in if they exited out of the blog for a period of time so hey would not have to sign back in every time they opened the website.
